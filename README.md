# DATA601 hw2

## Goal
My goal was to find places that serve tacos in the Baltimore area and determine how and if the number of reviews heavily impacts the rating. 

## Summary of Data 
For this project I used the [YELP API](https://api.yelp.com/v3/businesses/search) in order to obtain the data of 50 restaurants in the Baltimore area that serve tacos. From the API I got information about the establishment's name, latitude and longitude coordinates, their rating, and the number of reviews on each restaurant.
